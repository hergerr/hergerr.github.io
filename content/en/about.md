## TL;DR;

I am a Fullstack Software Engineer currently working in [InfoGuard](https://www.infoguard.ch) DevOps team in Baar, Zug, Switzerland :switzerland:. I obtained Master's of Engineering degree in Computer Science at [Wroclaw Universtiy of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl) in 2022. Since then I have significantly deepen my expertise in web application development in **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, orchestration and deployment strategies in **Kubernetes** and **IT security**. I am passionate about automation and GNU/Linux operating systems.

## Motivation

I am deeply convinced that our passions and character traits always (implicitly or explicitly) determine choices in our career. I can speak only for myself, but I will try to name a few examples:

1. I decided to enroll to computer science studies to try to combine my passion to solve riddles and to try to delegate several laborious tasks to my computer. This choice has proven to be right, as I used to be in 10% of the best students who were granted Dean's scholarship and I graduated with a *"very good"* grade Engineer's and **Master's Degree**.
2. In early 2020 I started to take part in classes of German language, starting from rather weak B1 level. Through long-maintained **consistency** I started very quickly to explore sources outside my textbooks, which lead my to obtaining [DAAD](https://daad.de) scholarship at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://lmu.de) and later to C1 level in proficiency. 
3. At the same time I discovered my passion to road cycling and climbing mountain passes.

This three choices eventually led to stepping up and starting work as Service Platform Developer in Baar, Zug, Switzerland.
