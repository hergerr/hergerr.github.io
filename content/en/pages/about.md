## Who am I?

I am a Fullstack Software Engineer currently working in [InfoGuard](https://www.infoguard.ch) DevOps team in Baar, Zug, Switzerland :switzerland:. I obtained Master's of Engineering degree in Computer Science at [Wroclaw Universtiy of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl) in 2022. Since then I have significantly deepen my expertise in web application development in **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**, orchestration and deployment strategies in **Kubernetes** and **IT security**. I am passionate about automation and GNU/Linux operating systems.

## The short story behind the blog

I am deeply convinced that, in order to grow as a human being, one must constantly set new goals and strive to achieve them. Over the past few years, I have taken on several challenges that have brought me to where I am today and shaped who I am.

Many of these challenges are ongoing. It may seem that reaching a certain point means the goal has been accomplished — but in reality, it is only a milestone. On the horizon, there is always another point that appears even more compelling than the one just reached.

The motivation behind this blog is to share my journey as I work towards the next milestones in my life. Specifically:

1. I am a Software Developer. Although I have already gained a lot of hands-on experience, there are still countless opportunities to grow in this profession. My interests include, among others, design patterns, algorithms, data structures, and the many tools that support the development of modern applications.
2. In early 2020, I began taking German language classes, starting at a relatively weak B1 level. Thanks to long-term **consistency**, I was soon able to explore materials beyond my textbooks, which eventually led to a DAAD scholarship at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and later to achieving C1 proficiency. Through this blog, I want to practice writing and expand my vocabulary with more advanced expressions.

In my free time, I love exploring the mountains — both on foot and on my road bike. From time to time, I may share a word or two about that as well.
